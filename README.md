# 📊 Student Performance Dashboard

## 📌 Project Description

The **Student Performance Dashboard** is a beginner-friendly data analysis project built using Python. It analyzes student exam scores to calculate average performance, identify top performers, and visualize score distributions using clear and simple charts.

This project demonstrates how raw academic data can be transformed into meaningful insights with the help of **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**.

## 🎯 Project Goals

* Analyze student marks across multiple subjects
* Calculate average scores for each student
* Identify top-performing students
* Visualize performance using bar charts and boxplots

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
* **Matplotlib** – Data visualization
* **Seaborn** – Statistical data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook / Python Script**
* 
## 📂 Dataset

The dataset is manually created using a Python dictionary and includes:

* Student names
* Scores in three subjects (Sub1, Sub2, Sub3)

python
data = {
    'Students': ['Sanika', 'Pallavi', 'Dharati', 'Aarav', 'Meera'],
    'Sub1': [85, 78, 92, 70, 88],
    'Sub2': [88, 74, 90, 65, 82],
    'Sub3': [90, 80, 85, 72, 95]
}

## 📈 Data Analysis Steps

1. Created a Pandas DataFrame from the dataset
2. Calculated the **average score** for each student
3. Sorted students to find **top performers**

## 📊 Visualizations

### 1️⃣ Bar Chart – Average Score per Student

* Compares overall performance of each student

### 2️⃣ Boxplot – Subject-wise Score Distribution

* Shows spread, median, and variability of marks across subjects

## 🏆 Key Insights

* **Dharati** achieved the highest average score
* Performance varies across subjects, as shown in boxplots
* Visualization makes comparison quick and intuitive


## ✅ Conclusion

This project highlights the power of Python for basic data analysis and visualization. It is ideal for students and beginners looking to practice data handling, statistical analysis, and dashboard-style reporting.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

* Add more students and subjects
* Create interactive dashboards (Power BI / Tableau)
* Export results to Excel or CSV
